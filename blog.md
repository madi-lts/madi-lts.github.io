# Blog
This is a space to document various problems I have solved.

## MathJax
MathJax renders LaTeX to CSS/webfonts/SVG for high quality web-typography.
Here's an inline equation:
$$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)$$.
And here's a display-style equation:

$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$$


This post explains how to deploy MathJax within Jekyll.

## Jekyll
Jekyll is a ruby-based static site generator designed with blogging in mind. This post explains how I set up this Jekyll site.
